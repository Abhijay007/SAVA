 ### We source Content Creators as Interns to Startups.

Sava is a platform that allows startups to hire Interns. Fast. Crazy Fast.

We've recently helped companies like Angel Broking, GoMechanic and D2C in hiring interns.

Hiring an intern is a strenuous process for any mid-scale startup. It spans up to 3 weeks and sometimes it even ends up costing ‚Çπ‚Çπ‚Çπ without any decent results.
We help you hire creative interns in hours, not weeks. Cutting time estimated by up to 91% and cost estimates by up to 83%*.

How are we able to achieve that?
1. We have a highly engaging community of 3000+ Creators looking to be hired as interns. A single job post and you already have your ideal candidate in hand.

2. In the case of helping hire Blockchain Developers, it's more or less a similar scenario. Another niche, another community. One thing we can guarantee is: helping you hire a developer in under 4 days.
